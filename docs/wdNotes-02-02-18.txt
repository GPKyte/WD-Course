Lecture on Design

Design:
1) Elements
    Line(Solid and Implied)
        Character of line affects interpretation
        * Eyes go to areas of highest contrast
    Shape
        Visceral connotations
    Value
        Creates mood, functional, limits chaos
    Texture
        Create haptic(felt) response
    Color
        Hue is pure color
        Value is lightness, darkness
        Saturation is intesity of color
    Typography(Difficult)
        scale, kerning(space btwn letters), leading(space btwn lines),
            density, case, italic, bold, & color
        Should vary with type of information
2) Principles
    Balance(visceral)
        Ties in with perceived weight
        Symmetry vs Assymetry
    Proportion
        Rule of thirds, Golden ratio
        Harmony vs discord
        Should be intensional and obvious
    Movement
        Orthogonals-- Guiding lines to direct movement
        Tension
            Focal points
    Unity & Variety
        Create unity to break it with difference
        Repetition brings unity
        Limit variables
        Start from place of unity
3) Composition
    Grids
        Modular grid -- all sections the same size

Start with simple grid
limit variables
Make sure your hierarchy is clear
